# clip-embedding-api
API service for generating text and image embeddings using CLIP B/32 and L/14 models deployed on AWS SageMaker.

## System Architecture
![Clip Embedding Inference System](system_architecture.jpeg)


### üöÄ Features
- **Two API Endpoints**  
  Separate API Gateway endpoints are deployed‚Äîone for the CLIP ViT-B/32 model and another for the ViT-L/14 model‚Äîallowing flexible embedding generation.

- **Image & Text Embedding**  
  Supports both image and text inputs to produce corresponding embeddings.

- **AWS SageMaker Deployment**  
  Models are deployed on AWS SageMaker serverless endpoints for scalable inference.

- **Lambda Integration**  
  AWS Lambda functions handle API requests and interface with the appropriate SageMaker endpoints.

- **Monitoring**  
  CloudWatch Alarms and SNS topics are set up for monitoring model health and performance.
